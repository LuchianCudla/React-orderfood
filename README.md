This is a project where you can order food from different restaurants.
For this website I use functional components,the data is coming from a locally saved file,then I use a global context to pass the data to all of the components.
I use react router v6,link props,usenavigate and uselocation for the navigation between different components.
You are able create new users,login/logout,browse for different menu restaurants,add items to the cart/favorites,rate your food,filter and order by name,rating,etc.
